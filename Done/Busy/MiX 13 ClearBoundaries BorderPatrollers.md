# GPS Drift Detecting

## A brief description and name of the concept.
**GPS Drift Detecting**: We have seen a high demand, esp. in America, to effectively get rid of false border crossings. Due to GPS jumps / drifts, clients often see trips where there are state(border)-line crossing, where in fact there was none. Our aim will be to highlight trips with false state(border)-line crossings, with the use of Machine Learning.

## An explanation of why you believe your concept would be beneficial to MiX Telematics.
As mentioned above, this is an existing problem for many of our clients. It costs them a lot of time and money and developing this kind of solution will produce customer satisfaction. Seeing as this is an existing issue, there is a need to eliminate the headache. :-)
