## Notes

- OE-20

It should be possible to add the checkboxes. As per the asset list to the right of the config groups. We just need to consider how we do both (single selects [filter] and multi selects [config groups]) in the same column.
I am also not sure as to how to add the "header" (section) on which to place the show selected and the other action icons, but once again, should be possible.
Ensure the upload / compile functionality over multiple groups are catered for, else these end-points will needed to be edited or new, ones allowing for this, added.
There will now be different amount of columns possible in the top and bottom sections. We will need to see how to do this. I don't know of anywhere we do this currently, accept if we make this two separate grids and changing something in the top one triggers changes in the bottom one. Then it could potentially look like one grid, but this could be some work to get it going. The more I look at it, the more I think we need to make them two different grids, but this will need investigation.
Clarify "Filtering must be done against the Mobile Device column", should the top filter be updated to include Mobile Device Column?
Loading assets for the list is currently working off a specific config group. The BE logic will most likely need to change to allow for multiple groups' assets to be loaded.
In short I like this, however, I think it will be a bigger task. I think we could do an SP2 to pull out all the moving parts. Maybe this could be a good thing to do in a "Code Review" slot, so everyone on the team can see how to SP2 this type of story.
