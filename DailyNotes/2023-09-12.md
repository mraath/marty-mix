## Message to Fleet

- [x] Hi, I hope you are well, not sure if you are the right person to speak to? I had a chat with Julain about Airtime Management. The Iridium gave an error when you try to activate it. They have logged it as SR-16329. As far as I can tell the code points to fleet, however, I could be missing where fleet is calling us again :-) You can see it in the following Log. https://app.logz.io/#/goto/6b23d1ad34bc0ec3635ef9f819603df4?switchToAccountId=157986 âœ… 2023-09-12
