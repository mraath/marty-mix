## Worked on

- [[OE-515 Alerts Column Assets Panel]]

## Notes

- Justus: Hey man, hope you are well. I just saw the code you had to add for the BE to work with the DateTime Carrier. I think similar logic should already be in the BE as I think we got it from there in the first place and modified for the FR stuff :-) JUST noted it here - no need to change anyting.

[Pull request 114933: SR-19754 App is stuck on the Driving screen - Repos](https://dev.azure.com/MiXTelematics/Common/_git/Database/pullrequest/114933?_a=files)

- Hey, Sorry for not adding these story points... Thanks for standing in for me on this.
OE-539: 8 (Yes, this story touched SO many Repos. I guess a 5 could be fine, but if it was already passed on as an 8 it was well estimates Justus :-))
OE-497:  8 (Based off of my notes this could even be a 13, however, if this was already handed in as an 8 it is fine. Nice going Justus)
OE-496: 13 (Yes, this was huge if I look at my notes, Well done Justus)

- Sick-leave: 5 days

- TEST: OE-519, Zeshan already merged
