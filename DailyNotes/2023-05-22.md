## Worked on

- Navistar Test
	- I ensured the Org was Empty: MR Empty 1
	- There were NO Mobile Devices enabled.
	- I made Navistar available.
	- The log shows: CID: 1397281703945601024 Completed the insert of device Navistar OEM with orgId : 8422641239068046474
	- The Make Available modal kept spinning though. This might just be on my local machine, as it did the same on other devices.
	- Zonika suggested this might be because it’s the first device per org. Might not be a blocker.
	- If I refresh the page it does show it as Made Available:
	- ![[2023-05-22 Navistar Made Available.png]]
	- The default Event and Mobile device Templates are also present. The default config group is also present.
- Stellantis Test
	- I ensured the Org was Empty: Zonika_Stelantis
	- There were NO Mobile Devices enabled.
	- I made Stellantis available.
	- The log shows: CID: 1397286974969380864 Completed the insert of device Stellantis OEM with orgId : -2468395253657398636
	- The Make Available modal kept spinning though. This was on the jumpbox on INT.
	- Zonika suggested this might be because it’s the first device per org. Might not be a blocker.
	- If I refresh the page it does show it as Made Available:
	- ![[2023-05-22 Stellantis made available.png]]
	- The default Event and Mobile device Templates are also present. The default config group is also present.

## Notes

- [x] QA-5723: Hi @Sizaan Greyling, I saw that the “overwrite“ logic was never implemented for G52, TDI and Beacon on the excel spreadsheet. This must have been an oversight.
