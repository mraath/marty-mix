## Worked on

- [[MIX3K-9 MiX3000 Default Config Group]]

## Notes

- [x] Hedaya: The original issue has NO new messages. For ALL orgs the error seems to have come down a bit.
- [x] Zeshan: Wow, what a few days we've had with all the production issue... ai :-) Tell me, with the Audit Report, what was decided? I will quickly have a look at the Stored Procedure "MobileUnit_ConfigurationAuditDetails". OK, that's quite the stored proc :-) IT is 7 years old already and written by Jeremy. I think we should explain to Jeremy what we are seeing and if he would have any suggestions as to how to resolve that, if it needs to be resolved. I will think a bit more :-) OK. I had another quick look at the stored proc. I think the best is to chat to Jeremy. We might get away with just explaining the edge case to the client, but let's ask Jeremy before that.
