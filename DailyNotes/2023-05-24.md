## Notes

- [x] QA-5723 Follow up with Sizanne as to current status
- [x] Custom events:
	- [x] Add - show immediately on UAT?
	- [x] Delete? Immediately hidden?
	- /libraries-list
	- libraries-page
	- libraries/events > uses > GET_EVENT_LIST > 
		- ...DynaMiX.Backend\API\DynaMiX.API\NancyModules\ConfigAdmin\LibraryLevel\LibraryEventsModule.cs
		- method: GetEventList
		- I would compare this file on UAT (23.8) and INT and see what the difference is...
			- Some proxy changes, nothing that stands out
			- calls libraryEventManager.GetAllLibraryEventSummaries
		- IF it is the same (very likely) then check where it calls the list on our API
		- Then copare that file on UAT (23.8) and INT
		- ...DynaMiX.DeviceConfig\DynaMiX.DeviceConfig.Logic\Managers\LibraryLevel\LibraryEventsManager.cs
