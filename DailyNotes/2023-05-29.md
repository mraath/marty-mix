### What we did well:
- Focussing on one thing eg. Make Available, then knowledge and load sharing was very effective.
- Fixing up our code base, enhancing, is going to save us a lot of headaches going forward.

### What was a pain:
- Environment: DB Maintenance Service was a time waster. Thanks Zonika for jumping in.

## Outstanding
