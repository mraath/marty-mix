Branch: (Config/MR/DailyMerge/20230418)

**Daily Merge to Dev 2023-04-21**

### BEFORE doing the PRs - please note:

- There were many merge conflicts
- **FE**: I chose... INT (I think :-))

- When it comes to be **BE**, there was a merge conflict. I kept DEV, as it made more sense.

- The **API** had many merge conflicts. I tried going with INT, then a bit of DEV, the doing consolidation. The fact that DP changed release nugets on INT and then on DEV some developers need beta versions, I think it is best to allow the developers involved to update DEV and merge with INT. I really tried. Going forward I could do a best guess :-) But I think somewhere a developer will be sad and confused with code not working :-P
- The **API** had many merge conflicts too, however, the INT branch seemed to be the correct one seeing it is DP changes.
- In other places (non DP), I left BETA, if this was not correct, please change it to latest INT (I thought maybe a dev is busy trying new code with the latest beta)

- This didn't work, so I had to revert and rethink
