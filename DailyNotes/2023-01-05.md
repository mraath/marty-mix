## Worked on

- [[SR-14297 FM ODO sent through scheduler not being applied]]
- [[SR-14302 Active event negative temperature incorrect]]

## Notes

- [x] Comment SR-14297: I had a look at all the code relevant. When we read the value it comes from fleet services. I will double check with them, but I doubt that they will do any conversions on the value. We do a unit conversion if needed. When writing, once again, we only convert for unit types if needed. I guess the best would be to involve firmware. I tried to view a log entry which would show the values sent, however, for some reason it is not in the log file. I will however not let this keep back the story. RIAAN, will you maybe ask the firmware team to see what they do with values if they are to big, according to William's comment.
- [x] Comment SR-14302: From what I could see from the config file and UDP file, things from our side seem in order. I will double check with Paul, however, I think it is safe to ask Firmware to pick this up. RIAAN, will you please assign to them? Thanks.
