## Worked on

- [[STM-768 Client call to get selected event cameras for assets]]

## Notes

- xxx

OLTP failed....
LibraryDeviceChannels, constraints added but no cleanup script.
Deleted duplicates.
Shashi could restore a lot.
(He didn't restore the duplicates)
(Audit tables are available)

Library level Fine
Not in Asset Level

Theory:
- OLTP - delete templates if not in library if not connected
- Template entries not joining up with deleted stuff
