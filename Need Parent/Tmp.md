## Compelled by love

Hi all!
My name is Marthinus Raath. I am married to Liselle and have twins of almost 7 years old, Levi and Sadie.

Occupation?
I am a software developer aka computer programmer (or if I want to sound fancy, software engineer :-))
We write vehicle tracking, driver safety and fleet management software (all-in-one)
Currently I am also a website designer for Liselle's company in the making.... watch this space :-D

Where in Stb do you live?
We live in Unie Park. I love being so close to walking paths and single tracks to do some mountainbiking.
It also helps a lot being close to the kids' school!! All parents will understand this.

2 things that you like in general:
I love being outdoors, the favourite of which will be snorkeling, but not boring snorkeling... snorkeling where there is interesting marine life! :-D
Second thing would be to do adventurous things with my wife and kids.... travelling, exploring on scooters, hiking, mountainbiking, chilling on the beach.
I also love kite-surfing (of which I am doing WAY TOO LITTLE of)
I will stop now... :-D

2 things that you do not like?
I really don't like if something that is supposed to work is not working... eg. something you just bought, eskom.
I also really don't like being stuck in traffic and not being able to do something about it :-D
I don't like innocent people, eg. kids, going through terrible stuff... injustice.
I guess the list could go on.

The highlight in your Christian journey?
Definately the first time I experienced the Holy Spirit. I was SO lost and then I experienced Him. It was the same day I got saved. It was just such a moment of being made new... I cried a whole puddle of tears :-D

Cheers,
Marthinus

## Community groups

Hi Warren, I thought I'd just send a quick note.
How are you guys doing? I hope and trust the covid symptoms are totally gone now.
Tell me, regarding the "new idea" of people meeting in each others' homes... how are things going?
Is everyone getting in contact with someone?
Where can we help?
Are there any people who you are concerned about?
Anyone on the outskirts?

I know that Calla also asked for a few people from Jannie's group to come to your group...
Are they slotting in?

LAST QUESTION 🙂
Would you prefer voice notes / video calls?
I've found information or something like above is easy on a message or voicenote - only when needing to discuss things are video calls really needed.
(It is also easier to read these at more convenient times 🙂)

Hi daar - hoe gaan dinge?
Ek wou gou n paar vrae vra.

So oor die "nuwe" idee van mense wat meer in mekaar se huise moet kuier...
Hoe voel jy gaan dinge?
Is almal ten minste in kontak met iemand?
Hoe kan ons help?
Enige iemand waaroor jy concerned is?
Enige iemand op die outskirts?

LAASTE VRAAG 🙂
Sal jy voice notes / video calls prefer?
Ek vind inligting of iets soos hierbo werk maklik met n message / voicenote - slegs as mens iets moet bespreek is die video call regtig nodig.
(Dan kan mens ook kies wanneer mens dit lees en reply :-))

## Marty Handover 2020-12-14

The two main issues to mention here are:

1) SR-9291. On Production we are having issues related to the Mobile device settings tab.

  There is a WORKAROUND stored proc - Jacques was dealing with this.

  I have already deployed this to INT for testing.

  Both the BE and the FE repos had to change.
  They were both branched off of 20.16 for easy merging back into it.

  Branch name on both:
  Config/MR/Bug/SR-9291_ReEnableImeiAndButtons.20.16.PROD.ORI


2) VM-237. MiXTalk needs different timeout settings.

  I have already deployed this to INT for testing.

  This is a new story, so I branched this off of INT.
  The following repos were affected:
  - DeviceIntegration Core
  - DeviceConfig API

  I have already merged the Core repo into Int and then consumed that in the API, so nothing more needs to be done there.
  This was purely to get the new settings in there.

  The API was merged to INT.
  The branch name for both repos:
  Config/MR/Feature/VM-237_MiXTalkCommandTimeout.21.2.ORI

Dan is dit R1050 per beam...
Maar die een wat nou op is en nie werk nie was R1800.
So as n beam R1050 kos per beam, wat doen jy met die ander R750 wat oorbly?
Die som maak nie sin nie! Mis ek iets?

Good day

We have a very old alarm system and we need something new.
We don't want something which is too costly, however, we want it to be simple to operate.

We need three zones:
1) Inside the house
2) Outside
3) The flatlet

There is a part where the flatlet and the main house shares the outside, we need to make this work so that they wont trigger our outside alarm.

It will be great to make it smart, so I can see which zones were triggered, arm and disarm the alarm from my phone.
This online option must come without an extra monthly fee (as I know some do charge extra for this).

Would you be able to come out for a quote so we can get an idea what we are looking at price wise?

Please let me know when,
My phone (in order to Whatsapp)

## Geyser timer

Whatsapp chat
engineering.services@stellenbosch.gov.za

Good day
A few months (or years) ago the Stellenbosch Municipality installed a timer device on the mains of the electrical box in the house. This was meant to be used to:
1) Set times when the geyser should be switched on and off
2) Save electricity
This never happened with our house.
I saw my father-in-law (living in Die Boord) has his installed.
I would love mine to be installed as well.
We need to save electricity and this will help us a lot.
Could you please advise?

Thanks
Marthinus

Good day,

I hope you are well. 

I just saw that Cape Town Municipality has potentially scheduled load shedding during your stay with us (in the unlikely event of this happening, they will switch off electricity for no more than 2 hours a day). I am so sorry about this. Unfortunately, it is out of our control, since the entire Western Cape is affected by it. We left candles in one of the kitchen drawers just in case it happens while you are there, but let's hope it doesn't.

The WiFi rooter is on a backup system.

For an up to date schedule, you can download the app: EskomSePush. The area you should select is "Stellenbosch Municipality (2)". They will then notify you of the exact date and time this will happen. SO sorry again about this. I just thought I would rather inform you.

Please let us know if you have any questions.

## Flatlet

vrae vir tenant:

Good day, we are in the process of interviewing a few people.

Since we don't get to see you in person, we set up a few questions just to get to know you better.
(Some we might have figured out already, however, just answer them also :-) )

The reason for these questions are that you will be living close to us and we would want to know the people we share our lives and expose our kids to a bit better.
I trust you will understand.

Name and Surname?
Male or female?
Where are you from?
What do you study?
Do you smoke?
Do you want furnished or unfurnished?
Do you have transport? (car / scooter / bicyle)
Which months do you want to rent?

Thanks for understanding,
As soon as we can make a decision we will let you know.

Please feel free to ask if you have any questions.
Marthinus and Liselle

Good day xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

I know that you will love Stellenbosch. It is such a beautiful university town.
It has a lot of atmosphere and life.
Our house is very close to the university. The university is quite large though, so I'm not 100% sure where you will need to go.For this reason, I will give you a link to our house on google maps. You can then see for yourself.We are about 15 - 20 minutes walk from campus.
Our house is on a semi-hill, so if you were to use a bicycle, you could be there in about 5 minutes.
We usually rent out our flat on Airbnb, however, we would love a longer stay, so 6 months will work for us.
Our rental will be R5300 per month.
Here is a link to our Airbnb page, this is purely for more information and also if you want to read comments from others.
Many students have lived here and loved it. We once had a guy from Germany who stayed here a full month.So the link is just for information, not for pricing or booking :-)If you are interested and want to book, just use this email adres.
https://airbnb.com/h/relaxing-winelands-studio-apartment

Also, if you want to check out the map, here is a link to our house on Google Maps.
Please note that the time they show for walking is not accurate as you can take a quicker route through the park.  
https://goo.gl/maps/6aqYUpyg1tguecfn6

Please let me know if you have any more questions.
Please also let me know if you have received this email.

Thanks, keep well!Marthinus and Liselle

### TShirt design (Tee spring)

#### 1) room for sale (KWFinder)

- search: niche shirt (eg. rockclimbing shirt)
- relevant
- search volume plenty > 1000 pm
- 39 or below... else too much competition (close to green, better)
- if eg have 3 terms... then add 3 KDs / 3 to get ave.

#### 2) design ideas (etst.com)

- search: niche shirt (eg. rockclimbing shirt)
- top row = ads
- i) look for easy to create (eg. quotes)
- spin around
- simple designs
- ii) num reviews (check for thousands)
- iii) check actual review (eg. 5 star)
- screen shot for inspiration
- cant copy design - penalty - trust score
- by default have copy right - tell tee spring
- typorama (fine for profit) or wordswag (not yet) to write nice text

VISUAL: Copy write
TRADE MARK: Per country - search

Lifestyle images: Placeit


Sales pop master - Scarecity

Facebook: Check if banned



  
#### 3) Do the design with top app

- Start designing
- choose unisex tshirt
- quality (classic)
- premium if you want clothing brand
- Sell
- Add image and select file
- Resize and position
- not too big or too small
- product colour... not too many... overthinking
- 5 colours or less, white, blue, red, green, pink (BLACK!, dark blue, grey)
- Price: Use what is recommended
- Lower a BIT - beating up - not too low or high
- Maybe drop with about 2 dolors (19.99)
- Dont add other qualities -
- Maybe add sweatshirt - pick one
- Maybe tank top

#### 5) Need to keep clean

- Title: niche 
  - Look at eg.
  - Whats on the search
  - Keep simple
- Descr
  - Add some (noun: fun) to your (XXXXX) wardrobe with this (funny) (XXXXXXX) (shirt/design) or give it as the perfect gift! Choose your size and colour then **BUY IT NOW** to place your order.
- Edit first colour

Hi Chad. Trust your day is cool. Almost weekend! :-D
I am working on CONFIG-2264
It seems to be code you were involved in... 
AssetCommissioningManager.DeleteAssetMobileUnit >> AssetsRepository.UpdateConfigurationGroupAsync

If you look in Kibana you will see it goes to the following lines of code...
Could you let me know if you are the right person to speak to?
Thanks man

Hey Marty ek vir Jacques laatweet die nuutse MiX.DeviceConfig.Api.Client, Version=2020.7.10.3 Nuget het n dependency op MyMiX.PaOBC.Commissioning.Management.Shared. So ek moes daai Client install net sodat die shared daarso is. Jacques het gese ek moet jou laatweet. Kan julle dit dalk deel maak van julle dependency in die .nuspec of dalk kyk wat van die shared julle return ek weet nie?

Dit het my nogal n ruk gevat om uit te figure watse package daai veroorsaak het. Dis nou nie dringend nie ek laatweet net.




Donny has been doing a lot of tests.
In his last test he could commission a MiXTalk for Telkom and even phone my number from the unit.
The problem is that not all info is being updated. All statusses are also not being updated.

I will try to explain his finding here.
The idea is to get a game plan out of this.
My suggestion is to decide how to test each step if it succeded.
In thus doing we should get the culprit.

OK - so 30 foot view, Donny did the following.
Step i - set the Master Number.
Step ii - set the keypad number (my phone number)
He then tested this and could phone me.

If we have a look at the image below...

In pink we have Step i.
(Setting the Master Number, SMSC and Open Line)
From the UI (looking at the status) seems like the Master Number was set correctly (The status is Commissioned).
If we however have a look at the Tool's screenshot, we will see that the following happened:
- The Master Number on the device was set correctly (A)
- The SMSC Number was NOT set (B)
- The Open Line was NOT set (C)

Looking at my quick flow diagram at the bottom of the image...
For A (Master Number):
- Step 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 happened (setting it first to pending)
- Step 6, 7 happened (sending via MR Messenger to the unit)
- It then SET the actual number (A)
- Step 8, 9, 10 happened (Sending a reply via Mr Messenger)
- Step 11, 12, 13 happened (Updating the status unto the Kafka Q and into the status table, updating the UI)
For B (SMSC Number):
- Dont know where it failed, but we know it did (SMSC wasnt updated) (B)
- The flow would have started from 2
For C (Open Line):
- Dont know where it failed, but we know it did (Open Line wasnt updated) (C)
- The flow would have started from 2


In purple we have Step ii.
(Setting the Keypad Number)
From the UI (looking at the status) it seems like the Keypad Number was NOT sett correctly (Status Pending)
If we however look at the Tool, we see the following:
- The Button #1 (Keypad Number 1) WAS set correctly (E) 
(It is the same as per the UI (D))

Looking at my quick flow diagram at the bottom of the image...
For E (Keypad Number)
- Step 1 > 5 worked (Pending State)
- Step 2 > 7 worked (Setting the correct value for Button #1) (E)
- Then somewhere it broke... as the status was never updated... this could have been any step 8 - 13

We need to check the LOG for each step to see which steps are reached and which not.
Once we can see this, we need to do this a few times.
We can then start eliminating the problem steps(s)

## Afrihost

Could you please help?

I have no mobile data access.
Id: 7605225038081
Cell: 0741433223

In short - this is the problem:

The app says "Please check your APN settings"
I have followed your instructions.
No matter how I enter it (even when one of your people phoned to assist).

If I switch off my wifi, I have no internet.
So the APN is not registering.
