**In preparation for Session 8, please:**

1) **Please prepare your introduction accordingly:**

- **P – Personality Strength - personality trait you admire in the person**
	- He is a ==brave soul==. Who used to hide in the **shadows** of his computer screen.
- **E – Give clear evidence and make this fun if possible, based on some of our fun sessions**
	- But ==no more==.
	- We've seen him **step up** and out **of** hiding. 
	- He **shared** some ==courageous stories== and have **drawn** us into his **family life.**
- **I  – Inspire how does this inspire you or others**
	- I have **learned** from you to ==not let fear keep me back==
- **R – Reveal the name and surname make sure to pronounce it using pause part punch**
	- I **announce** to you, ==Marco Bronkhorst==
  
2) **Prepare a 90-second Magic Formula Report** on your use of the 3rd set of Dale Carnegie’s Human Relations Principles to be a more effective leader.  This commitment was made in Session 5.  Please **read 8.4-8.6 in the Participant Manual** and **complete the Demonstrate Leadership Report Planning Sheet on page 8.7**.

	- PREP
	- Franscouis
	- I need him to see his distractive behaviour
	- Indirectly (mentioned my own)
	- Talk about my own mistakes before criticising the other person
	- Easy to owe up to mistakes
	- I will share on my own life
	- Help people change for the good, willingly, happily
	- Talk about your own mistakes, then people will become vulnerable themselves

	- SHARE
	- He wants his ==mom== to start taking drugs with him
	- This is the ==deep== end I was thrown into. 
	- Still remembering my own **ideas** around this topic, now almost ==25== years ago.
	- How will I **help** this guy to see that he is on a ==distructive course==?
	- Yes, I ==prayed== for him and 
	- then I looked out for the correct ==timing== to talk about this.
	- Coming from that **mindset** myself I didn't want to ==alienate== him, but pull him **closer** and hopefully help him see what he is keeping himself busy with.
	- The moment just didn't arrive until my wife and I did a ==pre-marriage== course with him and his, now, **fiance**.
	- The need for this chat was ==bigger== than just himself, and from the looks of it his **mother**.
	- IT also has to do with his **fiance** who might need to put out ==fires== years from now.
	- Seeing the ==bridge== in our relationship wasn't yet strong enough to bring a **10 ton** truck of, **stop using drugs**, over it, I decided to ==share from my own life==.
	- So while doing the ==pre-marriage== course, I mentioned my life story and how I was set **free**.
	- After the session him and his fiance came talking to me and my wife. ==VERY open== to hear what we have to say.
	- I haven't yet had the proper dedicated ==coffee== session for the chat, but I am still **following up** and I know I should strike while the **iron is hot**.
	- Talk about your ==own mistakes==
	- Then people will be ==vulnerable== themselves for things they are going through


3) **Prepare a two-minute report** on an **incident** that communicates your **major benefit** from this **program**.  **Bring Evidence** of your breakthrough to support your use of the Magic Formula.  Be sure to tell the story of your **Professional** and Organizational Results Project and how your participation in this program has helped your organization achieve **meaningful results**.  **Read page 8.10 of your Participant Manual and complete the Celebrate Achievements Report Planning Sheet on page 8.11.**

- Major benefit (Life in daytight compartments)
- Speaches in the moment
- Names of people

- ==Water gushing== in everywhere
- The room is ==filling== up with water and I have only the air in the ==corner== of the room to breath
- No, this is not a scene from the ==Titanic==, this is a scene from my life
- There are SO many things to get to, ==professionaly== and ==personally==
- Sometimes it feels like water just ==flooding== in
- At times I would then just get ==lost under water==
- Like ==Zeshan== also once mentioned it in a feedback session, that I could work on being more **approachable** in stressful times.
- This is something I ==wanted== to work on
- It was also something I could ==see== in my own life
- One of the best ==benefits== I got came from a **story of a captain on a ship**
- In the story they mentioned how the boat has ==compartments==, which they can close off in times of **flooding**
- This ensures that the **whole boat doesn't get flooded**
- So I started to be ==stricter== on living in ==day tight compartments==
- But even **moment** by moment compartments
- While closing off the other compartments I ==no longer had to worry about flooding== or drowning
- An example would be where a ==new guy started== working on our team.
- I already had ==quite a bit== on my plate, but he needed to be shown the ==ropes==
- Immediately I ==closed off== an apartment and saw it for what it was
- ==Currently== I can only do this
- In this instance THIS is to be ==approachable==
- So I ==put aside time== to help him
- He could ==continue with his job==, which helped the ==company== a lot
- I could rest assured that the ==other compartments== I would get to in due time
- ==Live each day in day-tight compartments==
- It will ==release you from stress== and ==free you up to help others==

5) **Prepare a one-minute report** on your vision 3-6 months beyond this training.  Communicate specifically what is happening and what has changed (as if it is taking place right now). **Complete the “Renew Our Vision Report Planning Sheet.”**

-  I am more ==confident== and
- express myself more ==freely==
- I take ==risks== when needed and
- help ==resolve disagreements== where they arise
- I am ==persuasively== communicating my point of view and
- starting to ==enjoy impromptu== situations
- I am still living in ==day-tight compartments== and
- this ==helps== me to help others

- More people can ==finish== there work as I make time to help them, 
- this increases the company's ==productivity==
- In genuinely ==appraising== others, 
- it boost their ==confidence== > the company ==environment== > overall ==output== of the company
