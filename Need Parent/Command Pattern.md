![[Redis Cache and Command Pattern.excalidraw]]

## Overview

To further safeguard the cache and ensure that it's always up-to-date, you can use the Command pattern to centralize all updates to the data in one place.

The Command pattern allows you to encapsulate all of the information required to perform an action or trigger an event in a single object. You can then use this object to queue, log, or undo the action.

Here's how you can implement the Command pattern in C# to centralize updates to the data and ensure that the cache is always up-to-date:

1.  Create a base `Command` class that defines an interface for executing the command and undoing the command.

```c#
public interface ICommand
{
    void Execute();
    void Undo();
}
```

2.  Create concrete `Command` classes for each type of update that can be performed on the data. Each `Command` class should encapsulate all of the information required to perform the update and should update the cache when the command is executed.

```c#
public class UpdateDataCommand : ICommand
{
    private readonly RedisCache _cache;
    private readonly string _key;
    private readonly object _data;

    public UpdateDataCommand(RedisCache cache, string key, object data)
    {
        _cache = cache;
        _key = key;
        _data = data;
    }

    public void Execute()
    {
        // Update the data in the underlying data source
        // ...

        // Update the cache
        _cache.Invalidate(_key);
    }

    public void Undo()
    {
        // Undo the update to the data in the underlying data source
        // ...

        // Invalidate the cache
        _cache.Invalidate(_key);
    }
}
```

3.  Create a `CommandQueue` class that can be used to queue, execute, and undo commands.

``` c#
public class CommandQueue
{
    private readonly List<ICommand> _commands = new List<ICommand>();

    public void QueueCommand(ICommand command)
    {
        _commands.Add(command);
    }

    public void ExecuteCommands()
    {
        foreach (var command in _commands)
        {
            command.Execute();
        }
    }

    public void UndoCommands()
    {
        foreach (var command in _commands.Reverse<ICommand>())
        {
            command.Undo();
        }
    }
}
```

With this setup, all updates to the data must

be performed through the `Command` pattern, which ensures that the cache is always up-to-date. If a developer adds code to update the data but forgets to update the cache, the cache will still be up-to-date because the `Command` pattern guarantees that all updates to ...

Further, you could make use of the [[Command-Query Responsibility Segregation]]
