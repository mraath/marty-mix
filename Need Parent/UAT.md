## Jumpboxes

- Zeshan Khan: So I log on to HSDUBATS01 and from there remote to HSUATIIS18.
	- For HSUATATS01, I think the gateway has changed to uattsg3.mixtelematics.com

- Jacques Van Wyk: uattsg.mixtelematics.com has been fixed so you should be able to get to HSUATIIS18 directly
	- HSUATATS01 replaced with HSUATATS03
- Zonika: the gateway is uattsg3   and not tsg1,  that is what I had wrong last time, but I dont use a jumpbox in uat just iis
- HSUATATS03
