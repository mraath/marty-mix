Good afternoon Jacques,

As per our discussion earlier today, I would like to **extend** my **temp remote worker** contract for the year **2024**.

I am raising this now already, as we have a few decisions to be made soon, regarding this.

From what I have seen, during this year in Bali, it has worked really well. The team has benefitted from support I could provide due to being a few hours ahead. Bali is also not too far ahead for me to be disconnected from the team. I have been able to be in all the necessary meetings. Having some focus hours before SA awakes, also helps tremendously.

This extension will be for 2024. In a previous email I have mentioned some reasons why we want to do this, so I won't do this again, however, timing wise this extra year works perfectly for us as a family.

Herewith is some more information:

- **Country**: Indonesia, Bali
- **Dates**: January **2024** to December.
- **Visa**: Our Business Visa allows for us to work for a South African Company. Our visa also doesn't allow for us to get any income directly from Bali. This eliminates any potential Tax problems for MiX Telematics, including double taxation issues.
- **Bank details**: My bank information remains as is, an **SA bank account**.
- **Working hours**: It will remain as it currently is, as it works well for the team.
- **Internet**: Their internet is very **reliable**.
- **Electricity**: The electricity is always on :-)

I believe this year have shown that I can work remotely. I know that I am driven, and self-motivated and that it works very well for our team.

I have also spoken to my **tax consultant** who said it **will not influence MiX Telematics** in any way. The reason is the payroll will remain as per normal, seeing my salary will still be paid into my SA bank account and PAYE will remain as is.

I also had a look at the double taxation contract between South Africa and Bali, Indonesia. From this, it also shows that MiX Telematics will have no tax implications. 

If there is any tax issues, which I have missed, I understand that MiX Telematics will not be held responsible. I will be responsible for any such things I have missed, including any potential cost implications.

I really want to thank MiX Telematics for allowing me, and my family, this amazing experience to work remotely. I also appreciate your consideration regarding my request to extend this work remote contract for 2024.

Please let me know if you have more questions and thanks again for the opportunity to ask for the extension.

Kind regards,
Marthinus

Good afternoon Jacques,

As per a previous discussion, I would like to **apply** to become a **temp remote worker**.

This will only be for 2023. As a family, we want to go live in Indonesia, Bali, for several reasons.  
One of them would be due to what we experienced the previous time we went away as a family for 3 months.  
It was a great time to connect with the kids and my wife and these experiences are priceless seeing kids grow up so quickly there are only so many opportunities to do this.  
Our kids will also be in grade 3, which is perfect before they start writing exams the following year.  
There are a few more reasons which I will rather discuss in person.

Herewith is some more information:

- **Country**: Indonesia, Bali
- **Dates**: This is a temporary thing from January **2023** to December the same year.
- **Visa**: We will be able to work for SA, under a **tourism** visa.
- **Salary**: My salary will have no effect. It will remain an **SA bank account**.
- **Working hours**: I will still be available for **SA** working hours, whatever will be discussed between the two of us.
- **Internet**: As per our previous experience, their internet is very **reliable**. Sometimes better than here.
- **Electricity**: From what I’ve experienced, it is better and **more reliable** than here J

I believe the previous 3 months abroad with my family, showed that I am driven, and self-motivated and that it worked very well for our team.

I also spoke to my **tax consultant** who said it **will not influence MiX Telematics**, as the payroll will remain normal, seeing my salary will still be paid into my SA account.

Seeing that this is quite a large undertaking, organising homeschooling, renting out our home, storing our things, and organising many other things, we would like to start with all of this as soon as possible.

I do know that MiX Telematics will need to look into this and consider where they stand with my application and I trust they will give it some good consideration as it is very valuable to us to do this undertaking.

Please let me know anytime if you have more questions and thanks again for the opportunity to ask for this.

Kind regards,
