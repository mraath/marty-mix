		- I had **hope**
		- I had **clarity**
		- It was like I was a **brand new man**
	- **Backtrack**
		- About **3 months** before this I was your **typical student**
		- **Drugs, sex, party**
		- I was an exchange student in the **Netherlands**
		- Took **shrooms** and smoked **hash**
		- **Next moment** I woke up hearing: "**Call the ambulance** the South African is dying"
		- I **experience** many things that night which I would still **love to talk** about
		- Main point is **I ended** up in a place where 
			- I knew I **didn't have** to be
			- I fully **deserved** it, but knew it could have been different
		- It was a place of complete **hopelessness** 
		- I saw my mom crying at my **grave**
		- **Agony**
		- **Fear**
		- **Pain**
		- I **often tell people** I know it wasn't **hell**, 
		- but I think **God** allowed me a **pre-taste** of  where I was **heading**
		- Something to **wake me** up from my life choices
	- Trying to fix things myself
		- I tried to be a **good person**
		- But this **didn't last** very long
		- I tried making **better choices**
		- This was also **not successful**
		- But that episode brought me to my **knees**
		- **Searching** for **answers**
		- Searching for the **truth**
	- This brings me **back to the gift**
		- With this gift I **found forgiveness**
		- I found that I was **loved**
		- From this I could love **others**
		- I found a **person who's footsteps** I wanted to walk in
		- I learned to follow well
		- Even to **lead** others
		- I could see how this person **died for others**
		- So I could learn to **put others first**
		- I became **hopeful**
		- Full of **joy**
		- Someone who **didn't need other substances** anymore
	- **This gift I found** was
		- **Giving my sin** to **Jesus**
		- **Receiving his payment** for **my wrongdoings**
		- The **door** to that **terrible place closed**
		- A door to **eternal life** opened
- **What this says about me is**
	- I once was **lost**, but now I'm found, 
	- was **blind** but now I see
