To further safeguard the cache and ensure that it's always up to date, you can use the Command-Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) pattern. The CQRS pattern separates the responsibilities of writing data (commands) and reading data (queries) into separate objects or classes. By doing this, you can ensure that the cache is always invalidated whenever data is updated, as the code responsible for updating the data is decoupled from the code responsible for reading the data.

Here's an example of how this can be implemented in C# using Redis:

1.  Create a Command class that represents a request to update the data and implements an interface that defines the method signature for updating the data.
    
2.  Create a Query class that represents a request to retrieve the data and implements an interface that defines the method signature for retrieving the data.
    
3.  When updating the data, use the Command class to update the data and publish an event that signals that the data has been updated.
    
4.  When reading the data, use the Query class to retrieve the data from the cache. If the cache is invalid, retrieve the latest data from the underlying data source and update the cache.
    

Here's an example code:

``` c#
public interface ICommand
{
    void Execute();
}

public interface IQuery<TResult>
{
    TResult Execute();
}

public class UpdateDataCommand : ICommand
{
    private readonly IDataRepository _dataRepository;
    private readonly IEventBus _eventBus;
    private readonly Data _data;

    public UpdateDataCommand(IDataRepository dataRepository, IEventBus eventBus, Data data)
    {
        _dataRepository = dataRepository;
        _eventBus = eventBus;
        _data = data;
    }

    public void Execute()
    {
        _dataRepository.Update(_data);
        _eventBus.Publish(new DataUpdatedEvent(_data));
    }
}

public class GetDataQuery : IQuery<Data>
{
    private readonly IDataRepository _dataRepository;
    private readonly RedisCache _cache;

    public GetDataQuery(IDataRepository dataRepository, RedisCache cache)
    {
        _dataRepository = dataRepository;
        _cache = cache;
    }

    public Data Execute()
    {
        var data = _cache.Get("data", () => _dataRepository.Get());
        return data;
    }
}
```

In this example, the `UpdateDataCommand` implements the `ICommand` interface and is responsible for updating the data and publishing an event to signal that the data has been updated. The `GetDataQuery` implements the `IQuery<Data>` interface and is responsible for retrieving the data from the cache. If the cache is invalid, the latest data is retrieved from the underlying data source and the cache is updated. The `IDataRepository` and `IEventBus` interfaces define the methods for updating the data and publishing events, respectively.
