## Already discussed

- [x] 20230731: I wanted to ask about all the **commented** out code... used to be something I was asked to remove. Are we more relaxed about this lately? ✅ 2023-08-21
- [x] 20230802: I see a lot where we no longer use **enums**, future devs will have difficulty. Instead of eg... p.Id == "8986368806182725986" to use p.Id == paramater.OverSpeeding ✅ 2023-08-21
- [x] 20230804: **OrgId** being taken out from call to API. These used to be used for authentication. Sometimes not used. Should we re-implement these? ✅ 2023-08-21
- [x] SAME with AuthToken ✅ 2023-08-21

?? magic strings

- Commented out code (might have been discussed when I was not here)
- ENums needed. (future devs will have difficulty. Instead of eg... p.Id == "8986368806182725986" to use p.Id == paramater.OverSpeeding)
- **OrgId** being taken out from call to API. These used to be used for authentication. Sometimes not used. Should we re-implement these?
