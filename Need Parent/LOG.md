When setting up a log I usually go to:
[[Logz.io]] to something already set up like this:
[eg Logz.io](https://app.logz.io/#/goto/eb810565fb1757b4034f0b19bbccc24f?switchToAccountId=157279)
I then ensure the Env is set eg. INT
Then the date range
Then message is one of "value" "value2"
Once happy, I select the part of the time bar I want to share
I then hit share
Copy link
Paste that into my Jira or Note or Team

Once passed on INT you can reuse this LOG for PROD
Just adjust eg. Env, MobileUnitId, etc
