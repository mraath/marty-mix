**QUICK RECAP:**

When a ticket is done and needs to be tested it can go via two routes.

**Testing by another DEV:**  This is for things not available on the UI, techdebt, so specific things that we need to sign off but does not need tester involvement  These  go to status **Ready For Testing** and assigned to  **Ready for DEV testing**

**Testing by a tester:**  These need to be picked up and tested by a tester in Donny's team  They go to Status **Ready For Testing** and assigned to **DynaMiX - Ready for testing**

Unless you are picking up somthing to test and assinging it to yourself please do not set it to **DEV TEST** as then it is not going to be picked up and it will not be tested.  

Also remember that if you complete any work that goes to INT you need to monitor to make sure it gets tested and signed off, preferably before regression starts other wise you can be asked to remove it at the end of the sprint.  Please let me know if you have any questions
