# Documenting

Our team had a lot of places to document our work.
We are investigating an easy way to find information.
Here are just a quick few places information lives.

## Confluence

This is what we are trying to do with this doc. See if we can somehow push information here.

## Jira

Lots of information lives in Jira. It would be nice to combine all of this.

## Code

Often code also has some important information

## Teams

While talking to team mates, we often exchange information that could be used later

## Combining it all

### AI

I have had an idea to use some sort of ChatGPT, however, for now we don't have the time

### Obsidian

This uses normal markdown. So if someone can use a text editor they can use this.
It is very easy to then link between files and concepts.
We can then merge all our information into one place and just publish to Confluence.

### Single entry

It would be nice to only type information in one place and have it all merged.
Dream on :-D
