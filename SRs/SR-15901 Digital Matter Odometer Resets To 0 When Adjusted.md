[SR-15901 Digital Matter: Odometer Resets To 0 When Adjusted - Jira (atlassian.net)](https://csojiramixtelematics.atlassian.net/browse/SR-15901)

## Shorter Summary

Yubbies, etc must now be set as DME
Also happens on M4K and M2K
Check flow of code
- [ ] Debug in Jako's code section to see what happens for DME

## TODO
```dataviewjs
function callout(text, type) {
    const allText = `> [!${type}]\n` + text;
    const lines = allText.split('\n');
    return lines.join('\n> ') + '\n'
}

const query = `
not done
path includes ${dv.current().file.path}
# you can add any number of extra Tasks instructions, for example:
# group by heading
`;

dv.paragraph(callout('```tasks\n' + query + '\n```', 'todo'));
```

## Description

### Oyster units with issues

[[AU]]  
BMR Logistics  
OrgId=-8400939365829350376  
Â   
[[Oyster]]  
IMEI: 356726109918136  
Vehicle ID: 53  
AssetId=1392855913680777216  
First Adjusted Odometer: 428 808  
Current Odometer: 17Â 557  
Â   
IMEI: 359215100810101  
Vehicle ID: 52  
AssetId=1392855320593387520  
First Adjusted Odometer 437 375  
Current Odometer: 10Â 726

Reported Issue: 2 x Oyster updated the odometer and **after few hours it resets** to the **total KLMS** its done since installed.
you can see in my image taken i took screenshot with them updated and it took them

### What he thinks might happen

The odometer was adjusted prior to the unit being used (09/6/2023) as seen from the Asset page screenshot, however **after a few trip** the dealer noticed that the odometer has **jumped back**. I get the feeling that even though the odometer was **adjusted and showed** on the [[Asset details]] page the **trips started recorded from 0km instead** of the adjusted. Looking at the [[detailed trip report]] the trips all **started with a 0km** value.

### More

The odo was adjusted a second time on 12-07-2023 and reset again to 0 (2nd screen shot)
I have checked and both units are running the **latest FW**.
Only **added UDP from installation**. Let me know you require any additional dates.
Can you please investigate why the Odo keeps resetting to 0 and suggest a possible fix.

## Chat met Heinrich


Nou goeie chat met Peter gehad. 
Daar is blykbaar 2 odo fields, maar hoe die waardes dar uitkom weet ons nie.
Odo waarde kom saam met elke pakkie in, en Config apply net die [[offset]].
Hierdie lyk nie na 'n ofset issue nie want die waarde gaan terug na 0 toe in die [[diagnostics modal]].
Probleem hier is dat die odo in die Asset list is nie gelyk aan die waarde in die diagnostics modal nie.
En net om dit beter te maak - dit gebeur op die [[MiX2000]] en [[MiX4000]] ookÂ ![ðŸ˜¬](https://statics.teams.cdn.office.net/evergreen-assets/personal-expressions/v2/assets/emoticons/1f62c_grimacingface/default/30_f.png?v=v7)
Ek het my findings op daai ticket van jou as 'n comment gesit

## Helpful Comments From Jira

It seems like the odo on these is now correct, so it is difficult to diagnose
I have added the following properties to the [[MobileUnitStateHistory table]] in order to gather more information when this occurs
### Lutfi

Since 22.15 all DME devices should no longer be configured as Remora\Oyster\Yabby\etc, but instead should be DIgital Matter Mobile Devices in the UI
- [x] Check if these are set up as DME âœ… 2023-10-11
- [x] Check in code if command is handled by DME or eg. Romora, Oyster, Yabby âœ… 2023-10-11

Save works, but odo ==reset again next trip==
### Sashi

See [[MobileUnitStateHistory table]] for Odometer

### Heinrich

I found the same behaviour for a [[MiX2310i]] and a [[MiX4000]] on INT

## Progress

- [[2023-10-05]]
	- [x] Why can't I see a DME sender? âœ… 2023-10-11 NOT needed for DME
		- [x] Debug this path âœ… 2023-10-12
	- Can use this to log check the command sent
		- Something like:
		- CommandId=muc.CommandId 
		- UnitIdentifier=muc.UnitIdentifier
	
	- From what I can see looking at the Logz and History State table, the 4K Heinrich mentioned, the odo was never set
	- I will now check the 2k he mentioned. This was also not set.
	- [x] Then I will check the Original ORG units âœ… 2023-10-12
